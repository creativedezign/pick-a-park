          <h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>Feature Creeper and the Creeps Bio info</h2>

<h3>Jane Metlikovec</h3>
<p>As manager of the digital communications team, Jane is the spiritual leader of the creeps, and the original Feature Creeper. As a youngster she represented Victoria in table tennis. Now she uses up her seemingly endless reserves of energy wrangling her four-year-old daughter and thinking up new features to add to our project.</p>

<h3>Pav Kamat</h3>
<p>Our co head-developer, Pav has a degree in Electrical Engineering and a Masters in Graphic Design. She has somehow found herself in Digital Communications at DET. One of her favourite shows in My Kitchen Rules, ostensibly because she likes cooking, but in reality because she likes Manu. Pav spends a significant amount of time saying no to Jane’s ideas.</p>

<h3>Cass Allan</h3>
<p>Cass has a degree in fine arts and and is completing a masters in curating. Her interest lies in curating fine art and digital art to create a convergence of the traditional and the modern. As a fine artist, you’d think she would be a perfectionist. You’d be wrong.</p>

<h3>Kathryn Hill</h3>
<p>Kathryn works in internal Communications and has trained as a pastry chef. She traded desserts for data when she studied consumer science. She is hoping that this is a recipe for GovHack success. She likes guys with well defined thighs.</p>

<h3>Flick Case-Mejia</h3>
<p>Flick is the teams Graphic Designer and will split her time in GovHack weekend between making cool icons and wondering if it’s raining outside because she has to ride home. She likes eggs, milkshakes and dinosaurs. She likes milkshakes so much she is creating a zine about them. You never knew you wanted a zine about milkshakes, but now you’re thinking about it, aren’t you?</p>

<h3>Dan Morrison</h3>
<p>Dan is a team anomaly as he is a male, and doesn’t work for DET. As a software engineer, he fills out the other slot as co head-developer. Dan is a vegan and a runner, who likes to run in Melbourne’s parks. This not only allows him to keep fit and enjoy our cities green spaces, it also gives him the opportunity to forage for dinner.</p>

<h3>Jeff Hoogenboom</h3>
<p>The team’s second token male, Jeff works at DET creating video, which often consists of denying requests to film three-hour long seminars. He will start the weekend trying to be ‘Arty’ but will probably be found on Sunday afternoon muttering ‘Screw it, it’ll have to do’ as he rushes to finish. Jeff’s role is to document the work of the team, which equates to capturing them doing embarrassing shit.</p>
